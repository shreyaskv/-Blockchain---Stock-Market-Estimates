ConsensusIQ distinguishes itself by integrating blockchain technology specifically for crowdsourcing financial estimates on a wide range of companies, not just focused on cryptocurrencies or inflation metrics. This broader scope allows for leveraging the collective intelligence of a diverse group of participants, which is not commonly targeted by existing blockchain forecasting solutions.

Decentralized Participation: Unlike traditional financial forecasting platforms that might rely on a limited number of analysts, ConsensusIQ democratizes the input process, enabling anyone from around the world to submit their financial estimates. This can potentially lead to a richer dataset, reflecting a wider array of economic conditions and perspectives.

Enhanced Transparency and Security: By using blockchain technology, all submissions and their subsequent evaluations are recorded transparently and immutably. This not only ensures security against tampering but also builds trust among users as they can verify the integrity of the process and the fairness of the reward distribution themselves.

Incentive Alignment: ConsensusIQ uses a token-based reward system to incentivize accuracy among participants. This model encourages contributors to provide thoughtful and precise estimates, as their compensation and reputation within the platform depend on their performance.

Smart Contract Efficiency: Implementing smart contracts for tasks like submission validation, result verification, and reward distribution automates these processes and reduces the need for intermediaries. This can lead to lower costs and faster execution compared to traditional systems​ (St. Louis Fed)​.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
